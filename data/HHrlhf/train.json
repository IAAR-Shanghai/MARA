The goals of the proposal are: \nI would start by applying safety research to uses of language models that are increasingly complicated over time. For a given application, the first step will be working on a research prototype. After demonstrating success, the goal will be to collaborate with product teams to assess feasibility offline before running experiments with that product.\nI envision applying a number of safety techniques to practical problems, including debate, fine-tuning language models with reinforcement learning from human or automated feedback, adversarial training, specialized classification language models (e.g., for inconsistency, subjectivity, illogical arguments, or evasiveness) that can be fine-tuned with supervised learning, conversational simulators, explicit models of user value to improve alignment and improved robustness techniques.\nI propose starting with more limited scope language tasks that should be easier to work with, while allowing for improvements to commercial products in the near term. For any of these tasks, there will be iterations on translating tasks into a form that can produce results in collaboration with safety researchers. In many of these, it would be valuable to apply specialized models to identify inconsistencies, incorrect arguments, falsehoods, subjective results, toxic language, unfair bias, or manipulation. These models can also be used to provide automated feedback, supplementing feedback based on ground truth answers.\n* Intent detection - this is used in mainstream conversational agents today to understand a user’s goals to direct a predefined conversation flow\n* Summarization - converting documents into shorter summaries would be very useful (especially if the results are more reliable than what has been possible to date).\n* Document relevance - allowing users to explicitly state what information they are looking for - this task is about finding semantically relevant documents\n* Generating descriptions,",

In came Cara, a sweet, inordinately soothing woman based in Arizona whose virtual newborn-sleep class ($79) was filled with mantras (“There’s no better mama for that baby on the planet than you”), neologisms (“SITBACK”), buzzwords (“witching hour”), and a sense of connection with other parents who were struggling the way we were. And it worked. Once, I asked my husband how much he would have paid for Cara’s class had he known how invaluable it would be for us. “Ten thousand dollars,” he replied, instantly. (To be clear on the stakes, we would have had to take out a loan.) We had found structure and hope from this woman whose caretaking brand was built on being altruistic, inclusive, and loving, which is why the revelation that she had backed a candidate whose policy separated babies from their parents felt like a profound betrayal. (Dumaplin confirmed the donations and said she did not agree with all aspects of the Trump administration.) My inbox started blowing up with messages from other new moms who were devastated not only by that dissonance, but also by the fact that they’d lost a trusted figure who’d taken on a mythic status—who’d become a kind of idol.\"",
