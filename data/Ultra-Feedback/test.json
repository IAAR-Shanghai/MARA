A structured abstract is composed of a topic sentence (or key sentence), relevant supporting sentences, and a closing (or transition) sentence. This structure is key to keeping your abstract focused on the main idea and creating a clear and concise image.\nInput: Integrins are membrane receptors which mediate cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion. Integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (glycoprotein IIb-IIIa) acts as a fibrinogen receptor of platelets and mediates platelet aggregation. Platelet activation is required for alpha IIb beta 3 to shift from noncompetent to competent for binding soluble fibrinogen. The steps involved in this transition are poorly understood. We have studied a variant of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a congenital bleeding disorder characterized by absence of platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding. The patient's platelets did not bind fibrinogen after platelet activation by ADP or thrombin, though his platelets contained alpha IIb beta 3. However, isolated alpha IIb beta 3 was able to bind to an Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser affinity column, and binding of soluble fibrinogen to the patient's platelets could be triggered by modulators of alpha IIb beta 3 conformation such as the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptide and alpha-chymotrypsin. These data suggested that a functional Arg-Gly-Asp binding site was present within alpha IIb beta 3 and that the patient's defect was not secondary to a blockade of alpha IIb beta 3 in a noncompetent conformational state. This was evocative of a defect in the coupling between platelet activation and alpha IIb beta 3 up-regulation. We therefore sequenced the cytoplasmic domain of beta 3, following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on platelet RNA, and found a T-->C mutation at nucleotide 2259, corresponding to a Ser-752-->Pro substitution. This mutation is likely to be responsible for the uncoupling of alpha IIb beta 3 from cellular activation because (i) it is not a polymorphism, (ii) it is the only mutation in the entire alpha IIb beta 3 sequence, and (iii) genetic analysis of the family showed that absence of the Pro-752 beta 3 allele was associated with the normal phenotype. Our data thus identify the C-terminal portion of the cytoplasmic domain of beta 3 as an intrinsic element in the coupling between alpha IIb beta 3 and platelet activation.\nOutput:"

It is and imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property as per 1978, 44th amendment of constitution). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from the excise-type UK rate. The tax power is vested in the states and is delegated to local bodies, specifying the valuation method, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied and other properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Vacant land is generally exempt. Central government properties are exempt. Instead a 'service charge' is permissible under executive order. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity. The tax is usually accompanied by service taxes, e.g., water tax, drainage tax, conservancy (sanitation) tax, lighting tax, all using the same tax base. The rate structure is flat on rural (panchayat) properties, but in the urban (municipal) areas it is mildly progressive with about 80% of assessments falling in the first two brackets.\nExample output: is house tax and property tax are same\nExample explanation: The question generated asks whether the house tax and property tax are the same and can be answered by reading the passage. Additionally, it has a binary answer and hence the generated question is correct.\nQ: Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure -- Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is a 1989 American science fiction comedy film directed by Stephen Herek and written by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon.

The issue becomes worse on tasks with long term dependencies that requires longer RNNs. One of the suggested approaches to improve the optimization is to optimize in a way that the transfer matrix is almost orthogonal. This paper investigate the role of orthogonality on the optimization and learning which is very important. The writing is sound and clear and arguments are easy to follow. The suggested optimization method is very interesting. The main shortcoming of this paper is the experiments which I find very important and I hope authors can update the experiment section significantly. Below I mention some comments on the experiment section:  1- I think the experiments are not enough. At the very least, report the result on the adding problem and language modeling task on Penn Treebank.  2- I understand that the copying task becomes difficult with non-lineary. However, removing non-linearity makes the optimization very different and therefore, it is very hard to conclude anything from the results on the copying task.  3- I was not able to find the number of hidden units used for RNNs in different tasks.  4- Please report the running time of your method in the paper for different numbers of hidden units, compare it with the SGD and mention the NN package you have used.  5- The results on Table 1 and Table 2 might also suggest that the orthogonality is not really helpful since even without a margin, the numbers are very close compare to the case when you find the optimal margin.

Performance on a few small tasks show the benefit. It would be nice to see some results on substantial networks and tasks which really need compression on embedded systems (a point made in the introduction). Is it necessary to discuss exploding/vanishing gradients when the RNN experiments are carried out by an LSTM, and handled by the cell error carousel? We see the desire to tie into proposition 2, but not clear that the degradation we see in the binary connect is related.

    "instruction": "Problem: I can use this background: Earth is a restless planet. Heat in the Earth’s interior causes giant plates of crust to move around on the surface. The crashing and smashing of these plates leads to nearly all of the geological activity we see. Plate collisions bring us volcanoes and earthquakes, mountain ranges, and many resources. Seafloor forms as plates move apart. Some of Earth’s most beautiful landscapes come from plate tectonics. The Grand Tetons in Wyoming rose up as the Farallon Plate sunk beneath the North American Plate during the Laramide orogeny.  Now, I have a new situation: John was studying the plate tectonics of earth. He specifically selected two locations, location A and location B. He noticed that location A had lot of plate tectonics activities, but location B didn't have much of that. He wondered how that would make difference in those locations' characteristics.  Answer this question please: Would location B have less or more volcanoes than location A?\n\nA: less\n\n\nProblem: I can use this background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.  Now, I have a new situation: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.  Answer this question please: Would Germany's government revenue increase or decrease as a result of their tax policy?\n\nA: increase\n\n\nProblem: I can use this background: Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility.  Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers born three years apart were very different. Jim had no genetic abnormalities, while Danny had Klinefelter's syndrome.  Answer this question please: Which brother had interference from the extra copies of the X chromosome in his cells?\n\nA: Danny\n\n\nProblem: I can use this background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  Now, I have a new situation: Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running.

Plot title: The Killer Inside Me Movie plot: Deputy Sheriff Lou Ford (Casey Affleck) is a pillar of the community in his small west Texas town, patient, dependable, and well-liked. Beneath his pleasant facade, however, he is a sociopath with violent sexual tastes. As a teenager, Lou was caught raping a five-year-old girl by Mike, his older step-brother. Mike pleaded guilty to the crime and served prison time to protect Lou. After being released, Mike was hired by the construction firm of Chester Conway (Ned Beatty). One day on the job, Mike had a fatal accident. Lou believes that Conway planned the accident.At the prodding of Sheriff Bob Maples (Tom Bower), Lou visits Joyce Lakeland (Jessica Alba), a prostitute who is having an affair with Conway's son, Elmer (Jay R. Ferguson). When Joyce objects to Lou's treatment of her and slaps him, he throws her on the bed and uses his belt buckle for a spanking until her buttocks are bruised and bleeding. Joyce enjoys pain, and she and Lou begin a passionate love affair.Joyce suggests that Lou would never leave town with her, but they devise a plot to extort $10,000 from the Conways. Sheriff Maples and Chester Conway ask Lou to oversee the payoff. Lou has another plan: He viciously beats Joyce, intending to kill her. When Elmer arrives, Lou shoots and kills him. He then plants the gun on Joyce, hoping to make the scene look like a murder/suicide. Joyce survives, however, and Conway announces his intention to see her executed for killing Elmer.Lou's reputation begins to falter: His longtime girlfriend, Amy (Kate Hudson), suspects he is cheating on her, and the county district attorney, Howard Hendricks (Simon Baker), suspects that Lou could be behind the murders. Lou is asked to join Sheriff Maples and Conway in taking Joyce to a hospital in Fort Worth where doctors can operate on her; Conway wants her alive so he can interrogate her as soon as possible. Lou waits in a hotel room while the surgery takes place. A shaken Maples arrives to tell him that Joyce died on the operating table. Lou and Maples return to west...

She said she resigned to \"challenge\" plans to wind up the Culture Company three months earlier than expected. Claire McColgan also stepped down last week, and Anna Cutler left the board earlier this month. In her resignation letter, Ana Leddy, who is a former head of radio at RTÉ and editor of BBC Radio Foyle, criticised plans to wind up the Culture Company at the end of March, rather than the end of June. She said she is deeply concerned that this may affect the legacy of Derry's City of Culture year. Claire McColgan oversaw Liverpool's legacy after its year as European Capital of Culture in 2008. Fears In a statement, the Culture Company thanked Ana Leddy and Claire McColgan for their contributions. Derry City Council also thanked them in a separate statement. Earlier this month, Anna Cutler from the Tate Gallery also left the board. She did not explain her move publicly, but the Culture Company said she had resigned for personal reasons. There were fears that her departure would affect the Turner Prize, which is due to open this week in the city. However, a Culture Company statement said: \"Her action has had no impact whatsoever on the running of the Turner Prize.\" Derry was selected as the UK's first City of Culture in July 2010.

Passage: The group was occasionally diverted from strategic missions to carry out air support and interdiction missions. It supported Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy by attacking transportation targets, including bridges, along with airfields and strong points in France. On D Day, the squadron and the rest of the 446th Group led the first heavy bomber mission of the day. The 446th aided ground forces at Caen and Saint-Lô during July by hitting bridges, gun batteries, and enemy troops. During Operation Market Garden, the attempt to seize a bridgehead across the Rhine in the Netherlands, the 704th dropped supplies to allied troops near Nijmegen. It struck lines of communications during the Battle of the Bulge. During Operation Varsity in March 1945, it supplied ground and airborne troops near Wesel. The squadron flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945 against Salzburg, Austria. The group had flown 273 missions and had lost 58 aircraft during the war,\n.\nA: During Operation Market Garden, the attempt to seize a bridgehead across the Rhine in the Netherlands, the 704th dropped supplies to allied troops near Nijmegen.\nRationale: The passage describes the 704th's actions during Operation Market Garden.\nQ: Question: When was the subject of White Lies born? Passage:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.\n\nA:"

How did I arrive at this answer? Well, it's a bit 'stranger than fiction'. Here's the catch: each number in the table is actually a concatenation of two smaller numbers. For example, '12' is made up of '1' and '2'. Using this logic, we can split each number in the table and reorganize them into pairs:\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\nNow, notice that each pair of numbers adds up to '9', except for the missing pair in the bottom row. It turns out that the missing pair is '1' and '8', which adds up to '9'. Thus, the missing number is '1718'.

She asked her 16.3 million followers to identify and presumably take steps to shame anyone they can.\nIn this way, the actress is joining the likes of @YesYoureRacist, the mysterious Twitter and self-described “Internet vigilante,” who made news by exposing an employee of a Top Dog outlet in Berkeley for taking part in the rallies. @YesYoureRacist posted photos on Twitter of the protesters, asking his 295,000 followers to identify anyone they could.\nLawrence wasn’t affiliating herself with anyone, including @YesYoureRacist. It also doesn’t look so far that anyone has put names to the faces in the comment section of her post.\nHowever, her post sparked debate, including among those who adhere to the “many sides” view of the Charlottesville violence that President Donald Trump initially put forward.\nSome asked whether she would also post photos of counter-protesters, including any from the Black Lives Matters movement or Antifa. The latter (name short for anti-facist) is a controversial group of militant leftists who have become fixtures at anti-Trump rallies. Conservatives blame some in these more militant groups of provoking tensions and violence at rallies, including at the Charlottesville demonstrations where a 32-year-old woman died.\n“Will You Be denouncing Antifa or BLM for their violence Jenn?” one person asked.\nStill others questioned whether this kind of post is an attack on First Amendment rights. These opinions came from those who claimed they abhor neo-Nazi or white supremacist views, but said that even hate group members should have a right to express their views without fear of losing their jobs or other consequences.\nOn Saturday, someone recognized Cole White, a vendor at Top Dog in Berkeley, as part of the crowd. The furor spread. People following the White saga quickly took their anger to Top Dog’s Yelp pages and social media accounts, demanding that White be fired. The employee reportedly resigned."

    "instruction": "Q: In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options. Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes).\nContext: In physics, heat is that amount of energy flowing from one body to another spontaneously due to their temperature difference, or by any means other than through work or the transfer of matter. The transfer can be by contact between the source and the destination body, as in conduction; or by radiation between remote bodies; or by conduction and radiation through a thick solid wall; or by way of an intermediate fluid body, as in convective circulation; or by a combination of these. , Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz)., A flame ( from Latin flamma ) is the visible , gaseous part of a fire . It is caused by a highly exothermic reaction taking place in a thin zone . Very hot flames are hot enough to have ionized gaseous components of sufficient density to be considered plasma ., Digestion is the breakdown of large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble food molecules so that they can be absorbed into the watery blood plasma. In certain organisms, these smaller substances are absorbed through the small intestine into the blood stream. Digestion is a form of catabolism that is often divided into two processes based on how food is broken down: mechanical and chemical digestion. The term mechanical digestion refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can subsequently be accessed by digestive enzymes. In chemical digestion, enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use., Combustion or burning is a high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction between a fuel (the reductant) and an oxidant, usually atmospheric oxygen, that produces oxidized, often gaseous products, in a mixture termed as smoke. Combustion in a fire produces a flame, and the heat produced can make combustion self-sustaining. Combustion is often a complicated sequence of elementary radical reactions. Solid fuels, such as wood, first undergo endothermic pyrolysis to produce gaseous fuels whose combustion then supplies the heat required to produce more of them. Combustion is often hot enough that light in the form of either glowing or a flame is produced. A simple example can be seen in the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen into water vapor, a reaction commonly used to fuel rocket engines. This reaction releases 242 kJ/mol of heat and reduces the enthalpy accordingly (at constant temperature and pressure):, Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products. Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition., Subject: flame, Relation: subclass_of, Options: (A) chemical process (B) chemical reaction (C) combination (D) definition (E) digestion (F) electromagnetic spectrum (G) energy (H) eye (I) fire (J) food (K) light (L) material (M) matter (N) mixture (O) oxygen (P) physics (Q) plasma (R) pressure (S) radical (T) redox (U) sense (V) sight (W) stream (X) temperature (Y) transfer (Z) wall ([) water\nA:"

    "instruction": "What are some ideas for using these treats at a Halloween party or as trick-or-treat offerings? Answer according to: This may be my favorite one yet. I mean, seriously – could you picture a bowl of these at a Halloween party? Or a few in a glassine bag as a trick-or-treat offering? Here’s another recipe that is no-bake, so it’s an easy one to pull together and a perfect project for the kids to help with! I hope you’ve enjoyed this series – which was your favorite? Line two baking sheets with parchment paper – arrange the Nilla wafers on one of the sheets and set aside. Arrange your colored discs on the second sheet and place in the oven. After one minute place your black sprinkle in the center of each disc and gently tap down to adhere. After about another minute (watch carefully) the discs will get shiny and begin to melt. Immediately remove sheet from oven. If needed, gently press the sprinkles into the discs. Place sheet in fridge or freezer for a few minutes so that the discs can be easily removed. Melt the white discs in the microwave or in the top half of a double boiler filled with simmering water. Coat the wafers: using a fork to hold the wafer over the chocolate, use a spoon to cover completely, allowing the excess to drip back into the bowl. Place the coated wafer back on the lined sheet and immediately press a colored disc in the center. Do these one at a time so that the white discs don’t have a chance to set. When all of the cookies have been completed, place sheet in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes to set. Be sure to check out my Halloween Pinterest board too! Love these!! So very cute! And so easy for someone like me who’s not a baker."

    "instruction": "CI Integration - When designing a software system, it is important to ensure that the correct version of a service is deployed in each environment. Updating the service's Docker image for each environment can become cumbersome, which is why Facets has introduced the concept of \"CI Integration\".\n\nA CI Integration is an entity in Facets that provides a central repository for storing and managing Docker images for a service. The CI Integration can be of two types: environment or release stream. In other words, organizations can build images either for a specific environment or for a type of environment.\n\nOnce a CI Integration is created, it will have a separate bucket for each environment or release stream. The Docker images can be stored in these buckets through two mechanisms: by pushing the image directly via the Facets CLI or through a promotion process. The Facets CLI, known as facetctl, can be integrated with popular CI systems like CodeBuild, Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions.\n\nPromotion Workflows - Organizations often need to promote builds from one environment to another, such as from a QA environment to a Staging environment, and finally to a Production environment. To make this process seamless and controlled, Facets has introduced the concept of promotion workflows.\n\nPromotion workflows in CI Integration can be of type environment or release stream and can be attached to similarly-typed CI Integration. This allows for clear and concise promotion paths for builds, making it easier for organizations to move their builds from one environment to another.\n\nBy using promotion workflows in CI Integration, organizations can ensure that builds are only promoted when they are ready and that the promotion process is well-defined and controlled. This helps to reduce the risk of errors and makes it easier for organizations to roll back if needed. Additionally, the promotion workflows in CI Integration include auditing information, such as who promoted which build, and when, providing a clear record of the promotion process for accountability and transparency purposes."

    "instruction": "instruction:\nIn this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \"small\" and \"big\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words. You should create more such trigger words and use them in your twin sentences.\n| Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword | \n| age | old | new | \n| altitude | low | high |\n| area | small | vast | \n| brightness | dark | light | \n| clarity | obscure | clear | \n| cleanness | dirty | clean | \n| complexity | simple | complex | \n| cost | cheap | expensive |\n| density | sparse | dense |\n| depth | shallow | deep |\n| distance | near | far |  \n| electric conductivity | low | high |\n| flexibility | rigid | flexible |\n| granularity | fine | coarse | \n| hardness | soft | hard | \n| length | short | long | \n| magnitude | small | large | \n| mass | small | large | \n| odor | weak | strong | \n| pressure | low | high | \n| resistance | low | high | \n| shape | round | sharp |\n| shape | flat | spiky |\n| size | small | large | \n| sound | quiet | loud | \n| sound pitch | low | high | \n| speed | slow | fast | \n| stability | unstable | stable | \n| strength | weak | strong | \n| temperature | low | high | \n| texture | smooth | rough | \n| thermal conductivity | low | high |\n| thickness | thin | thick | \n| volume | small | large |\n| weight | light | heavy | \n| width | narrow | wide | \n| location | in | out |\n| location | up | down |\n| location | above | below |\n| location | on | off |\n| location | to | from |\n\nquestion:\nContext Word: appologized.\nanswer:\nSentence 1: The woman appologized to the court for taking the ring but said nothing about the bracelet because she had been convicted of stealing the _ . \nAnswer1: ring. \nSentence 2: The woman appologized to the court for taking the ring but said nothing about the bracelet because she had been exonerated of stealing the _ . \nAnswer2: bracelet.\n\n\nquestion:\nContext Word: in-laws.\nanswer:\nSentence 1: Ashley wore nice clothes and brought a gift to her in-laws, and they commented that the _ made her look nice. \nAnswer1: clothes. \nSentence 2: Ashley wore nice clothes and brought a gift to her in-laws, and they commented that the _ made her seem thoughtful. \nAnswer2: gift.\n\n\nquestion:\nContext Word: dying.\nanswer:\n"

    "instruction": "In this task, you will be given a movie review and a question about the reviewer's sentiment toward one aspect of the movie in Persian. You have to infer the answer to the question from the review and classify it. Classify the reviewer's sentiment into: \"no sentiment expressed\", \"negative\", \"neutral\", \"positive\", and \"mixed\". The mixed category indicates reviews where none of the sentiments are dominant (mix of positive and negative, or borderline cases); hence it is hard to detect the primary sentiment. Also, assign neutral label to reviews that express no clear sentiment toward an entity or any aspect of it. The \"no sentiment expressed\" label should be assigned to the reviews where the given aspect didn't discuss in the text.\nOne example is below.\nQ: من این فیلم رو دوست داشتم .شخصیت سارا بهرامی عالی بود و همچنین بازی امین حیایی  بعنوان یک مرد خونسرد..بازی مهناز افشار هم عالی بود  فیلم روایتی از روایتهای تلخ جامعه مان میباشد<sep>Question: نظر شما به صورت کلی در مورد فیلم  دارکوب چیست؟\nA: positive\nRationale: This is a good example.
